\* though, it needs to make sure that any entries it commits in its own term are
\* correctly transferred to new configurations. That is, before leaving a
\* configuration C, it must make sure that any entry it immediatelyCommitted in T is now
\* immediatelyCommitted by the rules of configuration C i.e. it is "immediately immediatelyCommitted"
\* in C. That is, present on some quorum of servers in C that are in term T.
